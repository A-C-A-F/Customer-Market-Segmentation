# Customer-Market-Segmentation
Unsupervised Machine Learning for Customer Market Segmentation. This is a combination of a mini-course and a hands-on project.

### Project Objectives
In this project, I am going to focus on the following learning objectives:
1.	Understand how to leverage the power of machine learning to transform marketing departments and perform customer segmentation
2.	Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset images.
3.	Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm
4.	Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
5.	Apply Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method
6.	Apply k-means in Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation
7.	Understand the theory and intuition behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm
8.	Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
9.	Compile and fit unsupervised machine learning models such as PCA and K-Means to training data
